          <p>
            My name is Donnie Wilkie; I use he/him pronouns. I'm an
            undergraduate first-year at UNC-Chapel Hill studying biology on the
            pre-med track and sociology. I also work as a barista at Joe Van
            Gogh coffee, located in Roper Hall on Columbia street. I love
            anatomy, physiology, and forensics.

          <h1>How I Can Help You</h1>
          <p>
            I have a plethora of experience. While in high school, I served as a
            research assistant at the N.C. State University, Wilson College of
            Textiles by studying how different dyes age chemically. I also was a
            student ambassador, giving tours to incoming students and their
            parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, I have a myriad of skills. In addition to my research
            experience at the Wilson College of Textiles and through classes
            like Classical Genetics. I also learned how to be an effective
            leader through my previous job as an NCSSM Summer Accelerator camp
            counselor.
